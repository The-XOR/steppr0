# Launchpad Step Sequencer

This will be a step sequencer for Renoise using the Launchpad.

## Lauchpad.lua

Here I define basic functionality the Launchpad delivers.

    pad = Launchpad()
    
    example_colors(pad)

should show almost all the functions that are possible.
You should have a look at that function to find out what is possible by the Launchpad class.
