# The Awesome Step-Sequencer

Stepp0r is a Step-Sequencer for [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com/)
on the [Launchpad](http://novationmusic.de/midi-controllers-digital-dj/launchpad)
written by Palo van Dalo.
Right now, it's working fine as a _"forget the computer"_ type control.
You can punch in your sequences, or you can use the keyboard to record your melodies
using the osc server of [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com/).

## You want to start using it? 
* Buy a launchpad (at ebay for example).
* [Download]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/{{ site.actual_version }}) the plugin.
* [Install the plugin](http://www.renoise.com/tools) in renoise.
* Have a look at the  [Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/).

If you find bugs please report them
[here](https://github.com/mrVanDalo/stepp0r/issues) 
or use UserVoice (on the bottom right).

And if you want to join the development just visit the
