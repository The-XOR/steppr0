# The Awesome Step-Sequencer

Stepp0r is a Step-Sequencer for [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com/)
written by Palo van Dalo on the [Launchpad](http://novationmusic.de/midi-controllers-digital-dj/launchpad).
Right now, it's working fine as a _"forget the computer"_ type control.
You can punch in your sequences, or you can use the keyboard to record your melodies.

## You want to start using it? 
* Buy a launchpad (at ebay for example).
* [Download]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/Stepp0r-0.3.xrnx) the plugin.
* [Install the plugin](http://www.renoise.com/tools) in renoise.
* Have a look at the  [Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/).
