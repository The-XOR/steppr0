## Introduction

*Stepp0r* can be used as an easy to use interface for the tracking interface of 
[**Renoise**](http://www.renoise.com/).
It gives you basic usage to 
[**Renoise**](http://www.renoise.com/)
which already exists. 
So you don't _have_ to use it.

> There is only one restriction : 
> InstrumentX will always be on TrackX

## Parts
